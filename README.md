A test set of contrastive translation pairs for machine translation analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a set of 97000 contrastive translation pairs for the
analysis of (neural) machine translation. It is based on the EN-DE test sets
from the WMT shared translation task 2009-2016.

How does the evaluation work?
-----------------------------

The core idea is that we measure whether a reference translation is more probable under a NMT model
than a contrastive translation which introduces a specific type of error. Starting from the WMT test sets,
we automatically introduced errors into the reference translations. After an NMT model scores both the original
translations and all contrastive translations in the test set, we compute the accuracy of the model for each error category,
that is the relative number of times that the model gives a higher probability to the human reference than the contrastive translation.

Usage instructions
------------------

 - extract plain text parallel corpus:
   python json_to_plaintext.py lingeval97

 - preprocess lingeval97.{de,en} and score each sentence pair with an English-German NMT model.
   In the directory `baselines`, we provide the raw output of all baselines reported in the paper (see below for reference).

 - evaluate a system:
   python evaluate.py -r lingeval97.json < baselines/sennrich2016.scores

What error types are included in the test set?
----------------------------------------------

We automatically introduce a number of translation errors that are known to be challenging for MT:

 - noun phrase agreement: German determiners must agree with their head noun in case, number, and gender. We randomly change the gender of a singular definite determiner to introduce an agreement error.
 - subject-verb agreement: subjects and verbs must agree with one another in grammatical number and person. We swap the grammatical number of a verb to introduce an agreement error with the subject.
 - subject adequacy: if the German subject is `sie` ('they', 'she'), changing the grammatical number of the verb does not make the translation ungrammatical, but changes the meaning.
 - auxiliaries: some German verbs are accompanied by the auxiliary `haben` ('have') others by `sein` ('be'). We introduce errors by swapping the auxiliary.
 - separable verb particle: in German, verbs and their separable prefix often form a discontiguous semantic unit. We replace a separable verb particle with one that has never been observed with the verb in the training data.
 - polarity: arguably, polarity errors are undermeasured the most by string-based MT metrics, since a single word/morpheme can reverse the meaning of a translation. We reverse polarity in one of six ways:
   - deleting the negation particle `nicht` ('not')
   - replacing the negative determiner `kein` ('no') with its positive counterpart `ein` ('a')
   - deleting the negation prefix `un-`
   - inserting the negation particle `nicht` ('not'). We use POS patterns of the monolingual training corpus to find plausible insertion spots.
   - replacing the determiner `ein` ('a') with its negative counterpart `kein` ('no')
   - inserting the negation prefix '-un-'.
 - compounds: for German compounds that consist of at least 3 segments, and were unseen in the training data, we swap the first two segments.
 - transliteration: subword-level models should be able to copy or transliterate names, even unseen ones. For names that were unseen in the training data, we swap two adjacent characters.

Data format
-----------

For scoring, the test set can be extracted to raw text with `json_to_plaintext.py`.
The dataset `lingeval97.json` also contains annotations for more in-depth analysis.
Each entry in the dataset has the following keys:

 - source: the source sentence
 - reference: the human reference translation from the original test set
 - origin: the test set ID and sentence index
 - errors: a list of contrastive translations. Each has the following keys:
   - type: a string identifying the type of error inserted
   - contrastive: the contrastive translation
   - distance: for errors involving multiple words (agreement, verb particles, auxiliaries), the distance in words between the two.
   - frequency: for errors pertaining to content words, their training set frequency. For subject-verb-agreement, the smaller frequency is reported.

an example is shown here:

```
  {
    "source": "Prague Stock Market falls to minus by the end of the trading day",
    "reference": "Die Prager Börse stürzt gegen Geschäftsschluss ins Minus.",
    "origin": "newstest2009.1",
    "errors": [

      {

      },
      {

        "contrastive": "Die Prager Börse stürzen gegen Geschäftsschluss ins Minus.",
        "distance": 1,
        "frequency": 286
      }
    ]

more detailed statistics are possible, for instance reporting distance-level statistics for specific categories (use `--categories`).

The command-line option `--latex` collates and formats statistics like in the paper referenced below.

Use the command-line option `-v` to print out all contrastive pairs (of the active categories) for which the model prefers the contrastive translation.

Here is an example of a complex command that only calculates errors for the deletion of the negation affix, and displays all errors on stdout.
For test sets for which one-best outputs are available (newstest2014-16), the one-best is also shown:

    python3 evaluate.py -r lingeval97.json -v --outputs '{"newstest2014": "baselines/char2char.newstest2014", "newstest2015": "baselines/char2char.newstest2015", "newstest2016": "baselines/char2char.newstest2016"}' --categories polarity_affix_del < baselines/char2char.scores
